Rules:
  The computer generates a random string of colors
  the user wins when they guess the correct string
  If the user guesses incorrect, then the user is informed of two things
  1) The number of guesses where position and color are correct.
  2) The number of guesses where only color is correct.
  The user has a maximum of 20 guesses
